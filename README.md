APIs: Connects to external services to retrieve or send information, such as weather updates, appointment scheduling, etc.
Business Logic: Implements the rules and logic that dictate the chatbot's behavior and responses.
Machine Learning and AI:

Training Data: Uses large datasets to train models for understanding and generating human-like responses.
Algorithms: Employs various machine learning algorithms to improve the chatbot's accuracy and capabilities over time.
Continuous Learning: Continuously updates its knowledge base from new interactions to improve performance.
User Personalization:

User Profiles: Maintains individual user profiles to provide personalized responses and recommendations.
Context Awareness: Remembers past interactions to maintain context and provide coherent conversations.
